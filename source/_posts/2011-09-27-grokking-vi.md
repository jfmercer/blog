"Your problem with Vim is that you don't grok vi." So begins [Martin Kleppman](http://martin.kleppmann.com/) in what is [the best comment I've ever read on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118). It's more than a mere comment: it's an complete explanation of the rationale underlying *vi*. Before reading this, I thought that *vi* was a frustrating collection of arbitrarily named shortcuts that were assembled by the programming *cognoscenti* to deliberately shut out the vulgar *hoi poli* (including yours truly) from the arcane ivory tower of powerful text editing. I believed that the infamous steep learning curve was a form of geek hazing and initiation: those long-suffering few who persist unto the end will be admitted to the brotherhood of *vi*, while lesser mortals are shut out into the darkness proprietary GUI editors. 

Fortunately, I was wrong. Kleppman argues that "the 'Zen' of *vi* is that you're speaking a language." "Shortcuts" are simply not the right framework for interpreting *vi*. Hence, "the *y* and *d* 'verbs' take any movement as their 'subject.' " When I want to delete 5 words, I shouldn't think, "Dangit, what is that awful esoteric shortcut to delete?" Rather, I should "speak in *vi*."  Dear *vi*, please delete (*d*) five (*5*) words (*w*). Done. 

Perhaps even the notion of a shortcut is an unconscious borrowing from the land of the GUIs. Because we've lived in this land for most of our computing lives, we imagine that GUI language is the only language, and we try to force *vi*'s language into linguistically familiar categories, such as the "shortcut."

These aren't shortcuts. This is language.
