<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/13/apple-almost-worth-more-than-microsoft-hp-and-dell-combined/">TUAW reports</a> that Apple is almost worth more than Microsoft, Dell, &amp; HP combined. A few years ago, no one would have believed that this was possible:

<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; line-height: 32.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica; color: #515049} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 32.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica; color: #515049} --><em>After a slight dip in its stock last week, Apple is now valued at US$301 billion which is slightly less than the $302 billion of Microsoft ($200 billion), HP ($72.8 billion) and Dell ($29.3 billion) combined. Apple's position is even more impressive when you compare it to other tech and mobile leaders.</em>

<em>Last year, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/05/26/aapl-passes-microsoft-to-reach-2nd-on-us-market-cap-list/"><strong>Apple surpassed Microsoft in market cap</strong></a> and is now worth 100 billion more than Microsoft. This figure is more than RIM, Nokia, Netflix and eBay combined. It is equal to Amazon and Adobe combined and is only $15 million shy of Intel's total market cap. If it can grow that much in the least months </em>[sic]<em>, one wonders how much its lead will extend at the end of the next 12 months.</em>

One wonders indeed.
