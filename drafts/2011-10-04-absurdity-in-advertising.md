### Back in February, I analyzed and criticized Chrysler's much-lauded [Super Bowl commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL254Y_jtc). Here's what I wrote:

What struck me about the commercial was its irrationality: it juxtaposed a series disconnected & even contradictory images & words into an ensemble that made no sense whatsoever. Eminem, a luxury car, a theatre, a gospel choir, myriad images of Detroit, "tough" words from the narrator: none of these have anything to do with one another. Try transposing this commercial into a syllogism, and you'll get something like this:
    
+ Major Premise: Eminem drives a Chrysler
+ Minor Premise: There's a gospel choir
+ Conclusion: Therefore, I should buy Chrysler
    
* Major Premise: Detroit has been "to hell and back"
* Minor Premise: That mural looked nice
* Conclusion: Therefore, this isn't New York
    
- Major Premise: The theatre is empty
- Minor Premise: Who's driving that car?
- Conclusion: Therefore, America built Detroit
    
+ Major Premise: I feel really, really American right now
+ Minor Premise: (omitted)
+ Conclusion: Therefore, Chrysler.
    
The writers of this ad--or any ad for that matter--have presupposed that their audience is fundamentally irrational, illiterate, & incapable of grasping the absurdity of this "narrative." There is a vague appeal to emotion--perhaps to some vacuous, patriotic sentimentality supposedly found amongst lower & middle class Americans. But even this appeal to emotion is as vulgar & absurd as possible: it assumes that the sentiments of its audience are so infantile & base that they can only be persuaded by a fast series of rapidly changing images & words that in no way have the rhetorical & narrative coherence necessary to appeal to the emotions of anyone whose psychology has matured beyond pre-adolescence. In short, this commercial not only presupposes that I'm idiot, but that I'm still a child. And a very small child at that. 

Of course, this phenomenon of absurdity is by no means limited to Super Bowl commercials. If anything, this group of commercials are exemplars of this phenomenon. Viewed as cultural artifacts, one is forced to conclude that they come from a society of fundamentally irrational, illiterate, & emotionally immature human beings whose attention spans are too short even to recognize the difference between a narrative & a collage of non-sense.
