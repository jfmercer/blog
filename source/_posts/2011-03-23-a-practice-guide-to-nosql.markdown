noSQL: Since most of us--myself included--cut our teeth on MySQL or variants thereof, the rise of noSQL solutions is new to many. If a relational database can no longer work for me, what do I do? Denise Miura at <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> offers a brief but comprehensive explanation of the new &amp; exciting noSQL scene. We already looked recently at a <a href="http://johnmercer.org/2011/03/20/nosql-solutions-compared/" target="_blank">quick &amp; simple noSQL comparison chart</a>; by contrast, Miura gives us the basic contours &amp; foundational ideas between the noSQL scene as a whole.
