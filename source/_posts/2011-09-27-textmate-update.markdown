Today Macromates, the makers of Textmate, [announced](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/whats-next/) that Textmate 2 Alpha will be released before Christmas. This will be a public alpha, so all of us should be able to get in on the action. Developers have waited for several years for this major update to their beloved Textmate. However, so far, such hopes have dashed as this program has gone the way of vaporware. We'll see soon enough if our new hopes will be realized. In the meantime, back to [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).
