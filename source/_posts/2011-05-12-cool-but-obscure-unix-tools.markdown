Kristof Kovacs gives us a list of 24 very cool but often remarkably obscure Unix command line tools. Some I had never seen before, such as <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/">ttytter</a>, a command line Twitter client written in Perl. Others were old favorites, such as <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.nethack.org/">nethack</a>.

I've got nothing but love for ole' nethack.
