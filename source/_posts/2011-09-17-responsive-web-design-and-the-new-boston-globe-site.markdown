If you haven't done so already, do yourself a favor & visit the new [bostonglobe.com](http://bostonglobe.com). This website is the latest masterpiece of [Ethan Marcotte](http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/), [The Filament Group](http://filamentgroup.com/), [Upstatement](http://upstatement.com/), and the Globe staff. This is a textbook example of responsive web design. How is that? Well, grab a corner of your browser window & resize it. Make it very small & very big. Notice how the website transforms based on the browser size. In a nutshell, this site is visible on any device with a web connection. There is no separate "mobile" site or "tablet" site. There is one site only, just as there is only [one web](http://adactio.com/journal/1716/). It works so well that it can even display on a 13 year-old [Apple Newton](http://www.flickr.com/photos/splorp/6141775264/sizes/o/in/photostream/). Thanks to innovations in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, more and more sites will look like this in the future. Congratulations to Marcotte & his brilliant team of designers & developers.
