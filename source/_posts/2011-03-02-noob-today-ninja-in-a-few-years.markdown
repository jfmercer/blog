This blog is set up for three reasons.

1) Learning Technology.

I am currently transitioning from a career in education to a career in technology. Like any major career switch, this will require the acquisition of new skills. This blog will track the progress of my I.T. studies.

2) Helping Other Beginners to Learn

This writing is not an exercise in solipsism. I hope that I will be able to help other beginners by sharing my discoveries.

3) Learning From Others

Learning is never done in isolation. Even the most hermetic autodidact has teachers in his books. I want to learn what I can from others, both noobs and ninjas. By sharing our insights with one another, we will advance together in knowledge, skill, and understanding.
