Roxio, the developer of Angry Birds, announced at Google I/O this week that they are creating an HTML5 version of Angry Birds for the web. Given that parts of the code, especially for some of the sound effects, rely on Flash, this is not yet a pure HTML5 game.

The levels are written in JSON. Does this mean that we'll be able to write our own custom Angry Birds levels soon?
