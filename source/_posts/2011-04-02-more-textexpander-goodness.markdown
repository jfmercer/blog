<p>SmileOnMyMac's <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> utility has long been a favorite of Mac OS X productivity geeks. Fundamentally, the program itself is very simple: it allows you to create short text snippets which automatically expand into custom text content. For example, in any program on my Mac, when I type "nname," it automatically expands to "John F. Mercer." This is especially handy for long, repetitive command line functions that you use often enough for their length to annoy you, but not often enough to justify creating another ALIAS in your .bashrc or .profile. After a while, TextExpander saves hours or even days of typing time.</p>
<p>Today I discovered a great site for TextExpander enthusiasts called <a href="http://te-snippets.com/">te-snippets.com</a>. This site is all about tricking out your TextExpander install for the sake of faster, more accurate, and more productive typing. It has a how-to guide to get you started with TextExpander. I especially like its links to public repositories that put together collections of pre-written snippets for specific uses. For example, one repository contains a collection of CSS3 snippets, which would surely be a big time saver for web designers.</p>
