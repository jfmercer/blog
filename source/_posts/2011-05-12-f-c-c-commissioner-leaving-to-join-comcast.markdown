The New York Times reported yesterday that Meredith Attwell Baker, a commissioner at the F.C.C., will be leaving her current post to join Comcast.

I wished this news surprised me. Sadly, it is just another all-too-common story of the revolving door between Big Business &amp; Washington, between Industry &amp; Government, between businesses &amp; the regulatory agencies which supposedly police those businesses. This reminds me of various episodes from our recent financial meltdown, whose history was written with both clarity &amp; wit by Joe Nocera &amp; Bethany McLean in <a title="All The Devils Are Here" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843634/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=johnmercerorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399353&amp;creativeASIN=1591843634">All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis</a>. Characters like Larry Fink (First Boston), Robert Rubin (Goldman Sachs), &amp; Hank Paulson (Goldman Sachs) went from Wall Street to the Treasury Department &amp; back again. It's as if the defense &amp; the prosecution were hired out of the same law firm: you may get high-quality expertise, but you can hardly pretend that justice will be practiced. The revolving door undermines, if not altogether eliminates, the system of checks &amp; balances that curb the abuses of power.

What stands out in Mrs. Baker's case is her brazen disregard for even the slightly semblance of basic ethics. Only four months ago, the F.C.C. finally approved--after an ugly year-long battle--the merger of Comcast &amp; NBC Universal. Mrs. Baker served on the F.C.C., voted in favor of the merger, and now going to works as the senior vice-president for government affairs for NBC. In short, her very job title declares that she will lobby on behalf of the very company she used to regulate.
