Contrary to fanciful rumor, Apple is not planning to drop Java or "go after" Oracle. DZone reports that
<ul>
	<li>Apple will contribute the code that they used for their private Mac Java builds as GPL code to OpenJDK</li>
	<li>Oracle will take over the stewardship of the Mac port of Java</li>
	<li>Over time, the Mac platform will become a completely first-class citizen in the Java world</li>
</ul>
