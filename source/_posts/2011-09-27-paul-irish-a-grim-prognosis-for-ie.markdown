[According to Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com/2011/browser-market-pollution-iex-is-the-new-ie6/), the future of Internet Explorer could prove to be a nightmare for web designers and developers. After conceding that IE6 appears finally to be dead, he laments that "IE8's death date is 9 years from now. Meanwhile, you won't have to worry about supporting Firefox 6 or Chrome 13 in November." 

Three central assumptions underlie Irish's projections:

+ Microsoft's policy is to support IE, Windows, & Office products for *ten years*.
+ One new version of IE is released each year.
+ IE ships with legacy versions of its renderer. Hence, IE10 has renderers for versions 9, 8, 7, & 5. By this model, IE 20 alone would have 15 different document modes/renderers. 

By summer of 2019, IE would effectively be 72 different browsers. Yes, you read that right: 72. Although that sounds absurd at first glance, Irish proves that this nightmare scenario is sadly realistic. Even if these projections are preposterous due to the inclusion of document mode in the calculations, we'd still be looking at 10 versions of IE being supported by Microsoft at any given time. All this while our current versions of Chrome & Firefox will have disappeared by year end.
