<p>Ars Technica reports that Apple is offering pre-release access to Lion <em>to non-developers</em> through a program called <a href="https://appleseed.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SeedPortal">AppleSeed</a>. Don't get too excited: Apple appears to be limiting this to a carefully screened, invite-only list.</p>
