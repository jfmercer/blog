<p>Ars Technica reports that another SQL injection attack is inflecting the cyber-realm. It's targeting a bunch of frameworks: ASP, ASP.NET, ColdFusion, JSP, PHP . . . you name it. The injection drops a bit of HTML in SQL fields on your server, and these in turn load a JavaScript from a remote server. Then your database is toast.</p>
