Last night I completed my <a title="John F. Mercer - Personal Landing Page" href="http://jfmercer.me/" target="_blank">personal landing page</a>. "What is that?", you may ask. The short answer is that it is a digital equivalent of your business card. It presents <em>you</em> in a condensed form. However, it is much more powerful than a paper business card. It unifies all of your online profiles in a simple &amp; visually appealing manner. It takes the chaos of your myriad digital personas (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, Flickr, Google, Last.fm, etc.) and combines them in a single place in a clear, simple format. Although there are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5534456/five-best-personal-landing-pages">a number</a> of personal landing page services available, I choose to use <a href="http://flavors.me">Flavors.me</a> because of its emphasis on style &amp; presentation. A landing page should capture the attention, rivet the gaze, and dazzle the eye. Flavors.me does this better than any other service I'm aware of. Take, for instance, just three examples of landing pages found there.

1. Samantha Valdellon's page arrests the gaze with a good B&amp;W photograph accompanied by simple text.

2. Mount Peru's page is proof that a band need not have an elaborate fireworks display in order to capture the attention.

3. Andy Montoya's page demonstrates that painting can be just as aesthetically powerful as the photographs that characterize the majority of landing pages.

By comparison, <a title="John F. Mercer - Personal Landing Page" href="http://jfmercer.me" target="_blank">my page</a> is a modest affair: a picture of the coast in my hometown embellished with plain, unvarnished text. I hope to improve upon in the future. In the meanwhile, I believe we'll see more &amp; more of these personal landing pages in our professional lives as technology rapidly transforms our media &amp; modes of communication.
